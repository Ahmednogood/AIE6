### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE6/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments

Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ‚ùìQuestions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- üèóÔ∏è Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- üöß Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1.  Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.

    - Aspect Tested:

    - Model output:
      Object-oriented programming, or OOP for short, is a way of writing computer programs by organizing data and code into reusable components called objects.

           Imagine you have a car. In OOP, the car would be an object that has properties like color, model, and speed, and behaviors like accelerating, braking, and honking the horn.

           These properties and behaviors are defined in a blueprint called a class. So, in our car example, the class would define what a car is and what it can do.

           By using objects and classes, we can create programs that are easier to understand, maintain, and expand. It's like building with Lego blocks - you can reuse the same pieces (objects) to create different structures (programs).

    I hope that helps you understand the basics of object-oriented programming! Let me know if you have any more questions.

    - Vibe Check Evaluation:

      - The model is able to explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
      - The model is able to use analogies to help explain the concept of object-oriented programming.
      - The model is able to provide a concise summary of the key points.

    - recommended improvements:
      - A brief coding example like car.honk() might help visual learners.
      - Could mention that multiple objects can be made from one class (e.g., many cars from the same blueprint).

2.  Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    Used Paragraph: "The internet has transformed how people communicate, learn, and conduct business. With just a few clicks, individuals can connect across continents, access vast educational resources, and participate in global marketplaces. While this increased connectivity has brought many benefits, it has also introduced challenges such as data privacy concerns and the spread of misinformation. As technology continues to evolve, society must find ways to balance innovation with ethical responsibility."
    - Aspect Tested:
      - Model Output:

"Of course! The paragraph discusses how the internet has revolutionized communication, learning, and business by enabling global connectivity and access to resources. It highlights the benefits of increased connectivity but also mentions challenges like data privacy issues and misinformation. The paragraph emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between technological innovation and ethical considerations as society continues to evolve."

Vibe Check Evaluation:

      - The model is able to accurately identify and summarize the main ideas.
      - The tone is clear, concise, and pleasant.
      - The structure flows logically and stays within the expected length.

    - recommended improvements:
      - Slight redundancy was noted in the repeated use of ‚Äúconnectivity.‚Äù
      - A cleaner version could rephrase to improve efficiency and avoid repetition.

3.  Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested:
      - Model Output:
        "Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, there was a lonely robot named Spark. Spark spent his days wandering the city, searching for someone to befriend. One day, while exploring a quiet park on the outskirts of town, Spark stumbled upon a forgotten and overgrown garden.

As Spark cautiously made his way through the tangled vines and wildflowers, he heard a soft chirping sound. Curious, he followed the sound to a small, injured bird nestled among the foliage. Without hesitation, Spark gently picked up the bird and used his robotic skills to mend its broken wing.

From that day on, the bird, whom Spark named Flutter, became his loyal companion. Together, they explored the city, spreading joy and kindness wherever they went. Spark had found friendship in the most unexpected of places, and his heart was filled with happiness."

    - Vibe Check Evaluation:
      - The story is creative and emotionally engaging.
      - The model introduces a clear narrative arc (problem ‚Üí encounter ‚Üí resolution).
      - The tone is kind, gentle, and consistent with the system prompt‚Äôs "pleasant tone."
      - The story is well-structured and flows logically and within the 100‚Äì150 word range.

    - recommended improvements:
      - Could vary word choice slightly (e.g. ‚Äúbustling‚Äù appears twice in the first sentence).

4.  If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested:
      - Model Output: "Hello! That's a great question. Let's break it down step by step to figure out how many packs of each you need to buy.

First, let's start with the apples. Since each pack contains 4 apples, to get 12 apples, you would need 12 divided by 4, which equals 3 packs of apples.

Next, let's move on to the oranges. Each pack contains 3 oranges, and you want to get 9 oranges. So, you would need 9 divided by 3, which equals 3 packs of oranges.

Therefore, to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

    - Vibe Check Evaluation:
      - The model is able to solve the problem correctly.
      - The model provides a clear and detailed explanation of the solution.
      - The model's response is concise and to the point.

5.  Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    Used Paragraph: "Hey! Just wanted to let you know the docs are done. Ping me if you need anything else!"

    - Aspect Tested:

      - Model Output: "Hello, I wanted to inform you that the documents have been completed. Please feel free to reach out if you require any further assistance or information. Thank you for your attention to this matter."

    - Vibe Check Evaluation:

      - The model is able to rewrite the paragraph in a professional, formal tone.
      - The original meaning and intent were preserved without sounding robotic or overly stiff.
      - The structure and flow reflect clear business communication standards.

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### üöß Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

Adjustments Made:

1. Improved Prompt Clarity
   What was changed:
   The user prompt template was updated to encourage better beginner-focused responses. For example, in the OOP prompt, a suggestion was added to use a real-world example and a line of code.

Why:
The original explanation was good, but could be improved for visual learners by including code.

How:
In user_template, we added:
"Use an example and include a short line of code if possible."

2. Temperature Adjustment
   What was changed:
   Temperature was increased from 0.0 to 0.5 in the OpenAI API settings.

Why:
A slightly higher temperature produces more creative and engaging outputs (useful for story prompts), without sacrificing accuracy.

How:
In user_template, we added:
"settings = {
"model": "gpt-4o",
"temperature": 0.5,
...
}"

3. Added Word Count Validation for Creative Prompt
   What was changed:
   After receiving the full model response, the system counts words and warns if the story is under 100 or over 150 words.

Why:
To ensure the model sticks to the creative brief and avoids responses that are too short or too long.

How:
In the main() function, added:
word_count = len(msg.content.split())
if "robot finding friendship" in message.content.lower():
if word_count > 150:
await cl.Message(content=f" The story is too long ({word_count} words).").send()
elif word_count < 100:
await cl.Message(content=f" The story is too short ({word_count} words).").send()

4. Added Smart Prompt Routing and Formatting Constraints
   What was changed:
   The app now dynamically adjusts prompt instructions based on the task type. For example:

Summarization prompts are explicitly told not to include code.

Math reasoning prompts are told to use plain text and avoid LaTeX-style formatting.

Why:
To improve the relevance and clarity of outputs by preventing unnecessary formatting or content styles.

How:
Custom conditions were added in main():
elif "provide a concise summary" in input_text:
user_template = "{input}\nDo not include code or examples..."

elif "how many packs" in input_text:
user_template = "{input}\nPlease answer using plain text only. Do not use LaTeX formatting..."

5. deployed the changes to the HF Space and redid the vibe check (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ahmednogood/LLM-bot-AI-MakerSpace)

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë‚ùì Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

The limitations of vibe checking are that you can‚Äôt really tell if the model has a specific error or not. The answer might seem great to one person at first glance, but to someone else, it could totally miss the mark or not meet their needs. It‚Äôs all based on personal judgment, so it‚Äôs not always reliable.
